## Question 1
I used grep to solve the question using -E as it is used for regex and then I added to expressions "EXP1.*EXP2" using .* as a and condition. Executed the command by making it executable by using chmod +x.

## Question 2
I solved the question using awk's sum command where I used "," as delimintor and defined it using -F. As visible the last column is $4 hence I performed sum command on $4 "sum+=$4" and then printed sum. Executed the command by making it executable by using chmod +x.
